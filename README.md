READ (DISPLAY)
* Display all job posting from databases
DELETE
* Employer can delete their job posting

#### Demo

#### UX
My Considerations for the website:
User : Employers to host a job posting
Considerations :
* they must be able to view, add, edit and remove a job posting
* can be viewed by applicants (Employee)


#### Technologies

2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
4. MongoDB
